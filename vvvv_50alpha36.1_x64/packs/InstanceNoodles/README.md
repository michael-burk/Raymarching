# InstanceNoodles
Alpha 0.3 "Tonkotsu"

Instance Noodles is a  modular patching system for Compute & Geometry shaders in DX11/vvvv.  Inspired by the fast & pleasant workflow in stock vvvv this lib aims to bring the same visual flow programming approach to GPGPU calculations & procedural geometry manipulation.  

Made with VVVV x64 33.7, but should work with newer versions. Requires VVVV + Addon & DX11 packs, and a GPU that supports Shader Model 5.  To install just place in /packs folder.
